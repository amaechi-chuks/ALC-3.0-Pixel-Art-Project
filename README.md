# Pixel Art Maker
This project was a final project of `UDACITY` and `ALCwithGoogle` program. The Starter Code, including HTML and CSS to build the application design was created by `UDACITY` and can be downloaded [Here](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).<br>
The **JavaScript**  Code was created by me, It helps the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece.
