# Pixel Art Maker
This project was a final project of `UDACITY` and `ALCwithGoogle` program. The Starter Code was design by `UDACITY` and can be downloaded [Here](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter)<br>
The **JavaScript**  Code was design by me for easy manipulation of the pixel grid without distorting the previous work.
