## Introduction

This project was a final project of `UDACITY` and `ALCwithGoogle` program. The Starter Code, including HTML and CSS to build the application design was created by `UDACITY` and can be downloaded [Here](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).<br>
The **JavaScript**  Code was created by me, It helps the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece.

 Try loading up `index.html` from the starter project to see how things look! Notice that the design.js file is implemented in the <body> tag in the index.html file. Your goal is to build out the `design.js` file to achieve all the interactive elements on the page!.
 You are to use the skills you acqiured during this program on udacity classroom to create design.js.
